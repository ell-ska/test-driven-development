# Color guessing game  
This game is built from [Max's tests](https://github.com/maxhaggmancmedu/testing-guessing-game), *however* this version doesn't pass all the tests since i redid it to use color names insted of hex codes, I though this version was more fun!

The source code for the original version of the game (that passes all the tests) can be found [here](https://github.com/ell-ska/test-driven-development/tree/original-game) and the live site [here](https://original-color-guessing-game-snowy.vercel.app/).
